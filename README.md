# LAS_pointcloud_change_evaluation
Evaluation measures for LAS filetype (LiDAR) point clouds (with Open3D).

The repository contains the evaluate.py file containing the evaluation module, that compares labelings of a pointcloud pairs, and runs low and high level analysis of the similarity of these labelings. Basically, one is taken as prediction, the other a ground truth labeling, and the prediction is evaluated vs. ground truth.
